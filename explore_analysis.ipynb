    "We explore how daily vessel counts derived from AIS (Automatic Identification System) data correlate with the daily and monthly close prices of the S\\&P 500 index. The workflow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AIS Processor**: Downloads, cleans, and filters seven days of AIS data at a time, removes duplicates and non-commercial vessels, maps each vessel to its nearest port, and stores the cleaned data.\n",
    "* **Financial Fetcher**: Uses `yfinance` to retrieve historical closing prices for the S\\&P 500 (^GSPC) and individual components, scraping the current ticker list from Wikipedia.\n",
    "* **Database Storage**: Saves cleaned datasets in a PostgreSQL database for efficient querying and reproducibility.\n",
    "* **Pipeline Class**: Encapsulates all data retrieval, cleaning, and storage logic.\n",
